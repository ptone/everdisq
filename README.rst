A 30 minute hack to mash up Evernote and Disqus

Since Disqus requires someone to set up a site intially - so yes, I am the
admin of all comments posted on everdisq.net

If you want to set up your own instance, this repo is already set up to deploy
to Heroku. Be sure to change the disqus configuration in the templates.
